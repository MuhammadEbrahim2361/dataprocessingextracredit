Tips to make it official:

To enhance this assignment for future use, please add the following modifications:

1. Add more clarificaitons for Exception Handling: Specify the type of exception to be thrown when an operation is called in an invalid state (e.g., attempting to commit without an open transaction). Provide more details in the exception messages for better understanding by students.

2. Expand Test Cases in Examples: Possibly include more test cases in Fig 2 that cover a broader range of scenarios, such as attempting to commit or rollback when no transaction is in progress or performing multiple transactions consecutively.

3. Introduce Grading Rubric: Define a clear grading rubric, including criteria for correctness, code structure, and effective exception handling. This should help future students in providing constructive feedback to other students and ensures consistency in evaluation.

4. Challenge Students with Extensions: Encourage students to extend the functionality, such as supporting additional data types, implementing a persistent storage layer, or optimizing performance. This allows for a more challenging assignment for advanced students. Offer extra credit for this though.

By adding these modificationn for this assignment, it will become more comprehensive, and allows for a richer learning experience for students.
